## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, 
advised by [Dr. Abol Asudeh](https://asudeh.github.io/). I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics at Sharif University of Technology.


My research is mainly focused on **Algorithm Design** and **Data Science**. 
I design efficient algorithms to manage large-scale data in various stages of Machine Learning and Data Science pipeline. 
This includes Data Reranking, Debiasing, and Mining meaningful insight from data. 
<!-- I explore the integration of **large language models (LLMs)** and **Computation Geometry** within data science tasks, particularly in optimizing and analyzing complex datasets in high-dimensional spaces. -->
I'm also exploring how these methods can be integrated to enhance **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
Beyond this, I'm interested in **Computational Geometry** and its applications in data science, especially when it comes to optimizing and analyzing complex, d-dimensional datasets.

In general, I'm fascinated by any problem defined on a large set of points or tuples in a _d-dimensional_ space!
