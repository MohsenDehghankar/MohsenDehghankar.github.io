#### About

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago, 
advised by [Dr. Abolfazl Asudeh](https://asudeh.github.io/). I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering, with a minor in Mathematics, at Sharif University of Technology.

My research primarily focuses on **algorithm design** and **data science** with an emphasize on developing algorithms to optimize various stages of machine learning and data science pipelines. I am also exploring algorithmic approaches to improve the efficiency of **large language models (LLMs)**. 

In addition, I have a strong interest in **geometric algorithms** and computational geometry, particularly in their applications to data science and database problems.
